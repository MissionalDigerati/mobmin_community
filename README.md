#MobMin Resources (Pligg)
=========================

This is the repository for the #MobMin Twitter hashtag community portal.  #MobMin is a collection of resources focusing in the use of mobile technology for fulfilling the Great Commission.  Find out more at the [Mobile Ministry Forum](http://mobileministryforum.org) main website.  This community portal is built on the [Pligg](http://pligg.com) content management system.

Production Notes
----------------

When setting this up for production,  your document root should be the **webroot** directory.  Code above that directory should be inaccessible!

When upgrading,  make sure the links table retains the fields 'social_media_id', 'link_embedly_html' & 'social_media_account'.  This is to store the Twitter data.

Development Notes
-----------------

This repository is following the branching technique described in [this blog post](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), and the semantic version set out on the [Semantic Versioning Website](http://semver.org/).
